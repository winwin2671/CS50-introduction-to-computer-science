-If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

-Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?


1. I would characterize by there top 100 songs'average energy, valence, and danceability,
then calculate all of the data and send the user their unique audio aura.

2. The method might not be very representative of the listener because we just make an assumptions with the user songs'average data and
did not consider how does the listener feels. The better ways can be getting data from a survey of listener and base on that data.
